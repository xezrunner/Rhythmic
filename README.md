# Rhythmic

**Warning!** This project is under construction. The game is incomplete in this state.

## What is Rhythmic?

Rhythmic is a fan re-creation of Amplitude by Harmonix. It is based on the same fundamental gameplay elements as the original, including the smaller details.

Rhythmic also focuses on user generated content, letting players experience their own choice of songs within an Amplitude game.
